What is nml?
------------

nml is linear algebra maths library built for .NET.
I originally created it as a learning exercise for myself and to use in projects that require a 3d maths library. 

Current Requirements
--------------------

.NET 4.5

Goals
-----

* Unit tested - All core maths functionality should be unit tested.
* Fast - As fast as I can make it.
* Interoperable - So it can be used with other existing frameworks.

The current state & plans
-------------------------

There is currently no stable release, there are still a few things I want to add, namely:

* 64bit versions of Vectors/Matrices/Quaternions.
* SSE optimisations
* Better documentation
* More build targets

**If you decide to use this in your own projects, be aware it might change.**
